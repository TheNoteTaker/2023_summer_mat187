# How to Succeed in an Online Course

Online courses can be just as rich and rewarding as face-to-face courses, but it takes a little more work on everyone's part. The information in this post contains key elements that are important for your success in this class.

-   Begin **building relationships right away.** Please make sure you read my introduction and post one of your own so that we can get to know each other. As others join the conversation, please read their introductions, too.
-   Have **clear expectations**. Online courses are convenient because we have flexibility about when to do the assignments, but they take just as much (and often more) time than a face-to-face course. The national consensus is that a three-credit course should take 6–9 hours of your time each week.
-   Students who **set aside several short sessions throughout the week, at consistent times and days**, have the most success in online courses. Brain research tells us that "all-nighters" and long cramming sessions are the _least_ effective ways to learn and retain new information.
-   Be sure to **utilize the Chandler-Gilbert Community College FREE Online tutoring** service. Go [here](https://www.cgc.edu/student-resources/learning-center/online-tutoring) to get started! 
-   Because online courses require a written presence and participation, it is important to not only **read and compose your responses early in the week**, but to also **leave time to edit and proofread** your posts and assignments. It is recommended that you add major assignments to your calendar and work ahead on them a little each week, rather than try to knock them out all at once.
-   **Read the syllabus and all course resource documents** (rubrics, major assignment descriptions, and so on).
-   **Follow the learning trajectory of weekly Modules.** The order that the learning activities were constructed in a such a way to help you develop and build upon the ideas in a logical and conceptual manner so commit to fully working through the modules and in order. 
-   **Ask questions**. In an online course, the instructor can't see your confusion or frustration. If you are having a problem or any confusion, speak up sooner rather than later. Do not wait until the assignment is due to ask for clarification.
-   Make sure you have the **books and resources** you need.
-   **Save all work** (for online and face-to-face courses) on a flash drive; that way if your computer goes down you still have all your files and can work on a different computer.
-   **Ask clarification questions of your instructor and classmates.** Although this is an online course it is a learning community in which I will learn from my instructor and classmates and they will learn from me as well. In order for this to happen we must respond to one another. 
-   **Communicate in a formal, professional manner.** This is not a social media format, chat room, or text discussion. Please do not use text language or abbreviations but rather a college course that requires the use proper grammar and full sentences. 
-   **Respond to instructor feedback to your submitted work.** Feedback will generally be given with 48 hours (usually much earlier) so be anticipating that and be prepared to respond appropriately. 
-   **Download and save course resources you want to use often.** Download reading assignments posted in the course shell, especially if you will be traveling or have unreliable internet — that way you can always do the reading.
-   **Read all announcements (News Forum posts) in the course.** These are messages from the instructor. They will often have notices of changes, hints, or preview upcoming assignments.
-   **Check your college email and Canvas announcements**. This is the way the college (and instructor) will communicate with you.
-   **Deadlines are....deadlines.** Assignments will not be accepted after the due date so plan and work ahead to avoid last minute anxiety.
