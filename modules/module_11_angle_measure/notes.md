# General Notes

# Angles

- From a geometric point of view, an angle is the figure formed by two **rays** (or **segments**) sharing a common endpoint.
  - The amount of opening between the two rays.

- Because **s** is a portion of the circumference of a circle, **C**, the length of the arc, **s**, can be found with some constant, **k**
  <br/>**Equation: s = kC**
  - **Circumference: C = 2&pi;_r_** 
  - The constant of proportionality, **k**, tells what proportion of the circumference is included in the arc length.

We have two equations now and will substitute one into the other:

> 1. **s = kC** | **C = 2&pi;_r_**
> 2. **s = k(2&pi;_r_)**
> 3. **s = (2&pi;k)r**
>    - The parentheses moved because **2&pi;** and **k** are constants, turning **2&pi;k** into the new constant of proportionality.

The above shows that the arc length, **s**, is directly proportional to the radius, **r**, of the circle with constant of proportionality, **2&pi;k**.

<u>Example One:</u>

Assume the arch length is half of the circumference of the circle, so
**k = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>**:

1. **s = (2&pi;k)r**
2. **s = (2&pi;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>)r**
3. **s = &pi;r**

When the arc length is half of the circumference of the corresponding circle, the arc length is equal to **&pi;** times the radius.

<u>Example Two:</u>

Assume the arc length is one-sixth of the circumference, so 
**k = <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>**:

1. **s = (2&pi;k)r**
2. **s = (2&pi;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>6</sub>)r**
3. **s = <sup>&pi;</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>r**

When the arc length is one-sixth of the circumference of the corresponding circle, the arc length is equal to **<sup>&pi;</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>** times the radius.

## Proportionality

A quantity y is said to be **directly proportional** to a quantity **x** if **y = kx** for some constant value **k**, called the **constant of proportionality**. Consider the following examples.

1. .The circumference of a circle is directly proportional to its radius with a constant of proportionality **_2&pi;_**. That is, **_C = 2&pi;r_**.
2. The total cost of filling a gas tank is directly proportional to the number of gallons put in the tank. The constant of proportionality is the gasoline price per gallon. At a price of **$3.489 per gallon**, the cost is **_C = 3.489x_**.
